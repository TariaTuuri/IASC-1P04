## About the Game
Escape is a short game where the player inhabits the body of a witch who has been captured and is being held for her execution the next morning. Players must use the resources available to them as well as the help from some unlikely people to find a way to escape before dawn. This game conveys the themes that people can often suprise you and that it is always better to help people.
